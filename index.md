Markpond has a comprehensive API written using the OAuth2 protocol.

To consume the API, you must agree to the [API policy](https://markpond.com/developers/policy) and then [request API tokens](https://markpond.com/developers/tokens). Then, follow the [authorisation guide](https://markpond.com/developers/authorisation).

Once you've got your user authenticated, you can go ahead and look at the available [endpoints](https://markpond.com/developers/endpoints).

The examples given in these docs are written in Ruby, although they apply to any [language OAuth2 supports](http://oauth.net/code/).
